Hi there!

I hope all the requirements from the task-file were implemented,<br>
except "Using frameworks or libraries such as React/Redux" :)<br>

You can find the demo here(gitHub pages): https://achegevara.github.io/itrex-task-table/ <br>

The result file **index.html** is situated in the root folder of the project.<br>
The compiled "style.css" and "bundle.js" files are in the <b>/dist</b> folder.<br>
But I suppose the source(pre-build) files with my comments on the code will be more clear. They are available in the <b>«/src»</b> one.

<br>
As usual, type

"npm install"<br>
"npm run build" (or "npm start" if you need "watch"-mode ON)<br>

in the project directory if you want to rebuild the project using webpack.
